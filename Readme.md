# My Backend Engineering Notes

This repository contains my personal notes on Go, databases, distributed systems, algorithms, and backend engineering concepts.  
I maintain this as part of my journey as a lifelong learner and share it for anyone who wants to study along.

Topics include:
- Go: pointers, memory, concurrency patterns, goroutines, worker pools, semaphores
- Algorithms: DFS, topological sort, graphs
- Databases: SQL, NoSQL, indexing, transactions
- System design & distributed systems: caching, rate limiting, sharding, CAP theorem
- Kubernetes & Cloud concepts
